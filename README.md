### 📖 A bit about me:
⚡ I play guitar, sing in a choir, and enjoy hiking and cycling in my free time.
In addition to my passion for front-end development, I enjoy expressing creativity in other areas as well. I play guitar and love experimenting with different musical styles. Singing in a choir has also been a meaningful hobby, allowing me to be part of something bigger, while exploring harmonies and the joy of performing.

When I'm not coding or making music, I love spending time outdoors. Hiking and cycling give me the perfect escape to clear my mind, explore nature, and stay active. Whether it's the mountains or a quiet road, these activities help me find balance and inspiration.
